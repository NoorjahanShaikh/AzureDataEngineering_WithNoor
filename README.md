# Azure Data Engineering Repository

Welcome to my Azure Data Engineering repository! 🚀 This project focuses on streamlining data processing and engineering tasks using various Azure services. Below, you'll find an overview of the key components and processes involved in my architecture.

## 1. Storage Account 🗄️

In my Azure environment, I've set up a dedicated storage account to manage data storage. The landing folder within this storage account serves as the initial destination for incoming data.

## 2. Azure Data Factory 🛠️

Azure Data Factory plays a crucial role in orchestrating my data workflows. I've implemented pipelines that efficiently move, transform, and process data between different stages of my architecture. To enhance automation and responsiveness, I've incorporated Storage Triggers.

### 2.1 Storage Trigger ⚡

I use Azure Data Factory's Storage Trigger to automatically initiate my pipelines when new data is detected in the landing folder. This ensures a real-time response to incoming data, improving efficiency and reducing latency in data processing.

## 3. Databricks Integration 🚀

My architecture incorporates Azure Databricks for advanced analytics and data processing. Data flowing from Azure Data Factory is directed to respective folders, such as Staging and Rejected, based on pipeline execution results.

### 3.1 Staging 📊

Successful pipeline executions lead to data files being placed in the Staging folder, ready for further processing and analysis.

### 3.2 Rejected ❌

In case a pipeline encounters issues, data files are redirected to the Rejected folder for review and troubleshooting.

## 4. SQL Database Integration 📂

My data originates from SQL databases, and I use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for managing and querying data. The connection between SSMS and Azure databases ensures a seamless flow of data.

## 5. Encryption with Azure Key Vault 🔒

Security is a top priority, and I've implemented encryption using Azure Key Vault. This ensures that sensitive information, such as connection strings and credentials, is securely stored and managed.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with my Azure Data Engineering solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your Azure Storage Account and configure the landing folder.
3. Configure Azure Data Factory pipelines, including Storage Triggers, according to your data processing needs.
4. Integrate Azure Databricks for advanced analytics.
5. Establish connections with SQL databases using SSMS.
6. Ensure proper setup of Azure Key Vault for encryption.

Feel free to explore the codebase, raise issues, or contribute to make my Azure Data Engineering solution even more robust!

Happy coding! 🎉
